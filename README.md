Engagement Cloud for Magento
==========================================

## Description

This extension integrates Engagement Cloud with Magento Open Source 1 (Community Edition) and Magento Commerce 1 (Enterprise Edition).

- [Full support documentation and setup guides](https://support.dotdigital.com/hc/en-gb/sections/360000722920-Engagement-Cloud-for-Magento)

## Compatibility

- Magento >= 1.6.2
- PHP >= 5.4

## Installation

This module should be installed using [modman](https://github.com/colinmollenhour/modman#installation). 

Once `modman` is installed and available, run the following in your Magento root:

```
modman init
modman clone https://github.com/dotmailer/dotmailer-magento-extension.git
```

Don't forget to enable symlinks in:
`System->Configuration->Advanced->Developer->Template Settings`

Note: Following patch SUPEE-9767 (https://magento.com/security/patches/supee-9767) enabling symlinks via the admin panel is no longer supported. This can be done by running the following SQL query:

```
INSERT INTO `core_config_data` (`scope`, `scope_id`, `path`, `value`)
	VALUES ('default', '0', 'dev/template/allow_symlink', '1')
	ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE `value` = '1'
```

# 6.4.29

###### Bug fixes
- We fixed a problem with order sync, a regression from 6.4.22. The process could break in two scenarios: if we couldn’t find any products for SKUs listed in a collection of orders for a single account; or if the sync ran for multiple accounts, and only one of those accounts had orders.

# 6.4.28

###### Bug fixes
- We fixed a problem with product image paths in catalog sync. The default level base media URL was always used, instead of the value set at website or store level.
- We've added batching when removing orphaned products at the start of catalog sync. This should prevent occasional SQL locking issues.

# 6.4.27

###### Bug fixes
- We added a condition to check the exact version of Magento Enterprise, before using the newer Enterprise URL rewrite controller.
- We now apply CSS styles to our coupon EDC inline, to ensure they are correctly added in Gmail.

# 6.4.26

###### What’s new
- Codes for campaign tracking and ROI tracking applied to the **Get basket** link in the abandoned cart EDC are now preserved and applied at their destination.

###### Bug fixes
- Exclusion rules can now have conditions relating to product attribute sets.

# 6.4.25

###### What's new
- All contacts queued for email campaign sends are now checked against Engagement Cloud for their current suppression status. This reduces the likelihood of all emails in a batch being marked as failed, if a single suppressed contact is found.

# 6.4.24

###### What's new
- We've increased the sync limits for bulk imports into Engagement Cloud. The importer sync will now import up to 100 bulk items on each execution (25 of which can be for contacts), plus up to 100 single items.

###### Bug fixes
- We fixed a filename casing error that broke the page at Configuration > Engagement Cloud > Dynamic Content. 

# 6.4.23

###### What's new
- The insight data schema for orders has changed. Configurable and bundle products no longer output as separate line items; instead, parent data is used to augment child products.
- Simple products in order sync were commonly showing price 0 - we're now looking up parent prices for these where possible.  
- We've added _parent_id_ to catalog insight data schema. 
- We have deprecated some of our External Dynamic Content URLs. We've added notes on how to replace these in your campaigns.

###### Bug fixes
- We've fixed an error with updating products following an order sync - an exception was thrown once all available orders had been synced.
- We changed a line in our `UrlFinder` class that was causing a fatal error in PHP 5.4.

# 6.4.22

###### What's new
- The external dynamic content bestsellers list has been improved to display the configurable parents of bestselling children.
- All private methods in our code have been changed to protected, to make our connector's functionality completely extensible.

###### Bug fixes
- Our v6.4.21 upgrade script had an error that affected merchants using prefixed Magento database tables. This has now been fixed.
- We've fixed an error in our install script relating to the `last_imported_at` column type.
- We’ve removed some legacy markup from the HTML served by external dynamic content URLs.
- URL redirect management now displays and functions correctly in Enterprise Edition.
- We’ve fixed a bug with custom cart URLs when used with logged-in customer baskets.
- Purchased products are now marked as modified. This means the stock level updates the next time the catalog syncs. 
- Missing or invalid brand attributes will now not break the order sync.
- Subscribers who unsubscribe will now be updated so that their _SUBSCRIBER_STATUS_ data field in Engagement Cloud is set to 'Unsubscribed'.

# 6.4.21

###### What's new
- We’ve added a _type_ field to the schema for catalog insight data. 
- In catalog sync, child products without an image will now try to use their parent’s image.

###### Bug fixes
- We’ve fixed a bug with catalog sync which prevented a complete sync for merchants syncing a filtered subset of products. Products are now marked as _processed_ even if they are not imported.

# 6.4.20

###### Bug Fixes
- Synced reviews will now indicate the correct store, if placed on a store other than the default. 
- All Engagement Cloud campaigns will now be shown in dropdown lists, even if their total exceeds 1000.

# 6.4.19

###### Bug Fixes
- We now pull the reward points balance from the correct table, so an accurate balance is shown in Engagement Cloud.

# 6.4.18

###### Improvements
- We've audited the extension with a view to improving overall speed and efficiency. Particular attention has been paid to reducing database impact, pruning observer functions and cleaning up legacy code.
- Columns for segment ID data (used by merchants running Magento Commerce 1), are now added via the regular schema install script, and populated in batches to minimise performance impact.
- We've strengthened security by removing code that disabled SSL certificate verification. If this is required in some installations, it can be overridden by a config key.

###### Bug Fixes
- We've updated our check for an active coupon code in the Rule collection, to prevent a false positive result which was causing additional queries to be run on every page view.
- All extension logging is now routed via our dedicated connector log file.
- New customers, registering at checkout, will now be enrolled onto new customer automations, if configured.

# V6.4.17

###### Improvements
- Simple products in catalog sync and external dynamic content will now link to their parent (configurable, grouped or bundled) product pages if they are not visible individually. 
- Upon installing our module, both Page Tracking and ROI Tracking will be enabled by default.

###### Bug Fixes
- We’ve fixed a bug that prevented modified products being synced to all stores to which they belong.
- We’ve fixed a bug relating to our removal of the dependency on the Magento core review module. 
- Order confirmation emails will now be sent via the correct transactional email account, if configured to do so at website or store level.

# V6.4.16

###### Improvements
- We've improved the coverage of catalog sync by allowing selected custom attributes to be included in the synced data.
- In catalog sync, we are now syncing scoped (store and website) values for products, instead of only the default-level values.
- We resolved some code duplication in the dynamic content blocks.

###### Bug Fixes
- We are now cleaning any custom transactional data keys prior to import, removing invalid (non-alphanumeric) characters, but not skipping records as before.
- The Magento core review module is now decoupled from our contact sync.

# V6.4.15

###### Improvements
- We've improved the handling of double opt-in statuses in customer and subscriber syncs.
- We've made the re-subscription process more robust, ensuring that as statuses change in Magento and Engagement Cloud, subscribers are not accidentally unsubscribed.
- We've moved our announcement feed checking tool into a cron script for efficiency.
- To improve on boarding for larger stores, we've decoupled our installation routine. Our SQL tables can now be populated via a configurable command line script, after the module has been activated.
- We've removed any dependency on Magento's Mage_Review module if review syncing is not active.
- We now automatically mark as sent any campaigns that Engagement Cloud indicates are still "Processing" after 2 hours, in order to ensure subsequent campaigns are sent.  
- We've made various performance enhancements by refining our usage of some observers.

###### Bug Fixes
- We've fixed an issue with incorrect scope when saving the Engagement Cloud API endpoint URL. [External contribution](https://github.com/dotmailer/dotmailer-magento-extension/pull/312)
- We've repaired automation enrollments for guest subscribers when double opt-in is enabled in Magento.
- We've made the menu item for Abandoned Carts visible to all users with access to Engagement Cloud configuration.

# V6.4.14   

###### Bug Fixes
- We've fixed a problem with scheduled campaign sends, arising from campaigns stuck in a "Processing" state on Engagement Cloud. In such cases, we will expire campaigns that have been "Processing" for longer than two hours.

# V6.4.13

###### Bug Fixes
- We've fixed a bug that caused the catalog sync to skip products if invalid data keys were supplied.
- We've fixed a bug related to the use of `utf8_decode` in email templates (note this discontinues support for emojis in email subject lines).
- We've fixed a minor error thrown during the Engagement Cloud template sync.

###### Improvements
- We've improved the performance of the product sync process by setting a limit when querying products before import
